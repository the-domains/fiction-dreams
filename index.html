</picture><p><strong>Beyond the Rising Tide by Sarah Beard</strong></p><p>Kai met Avery only once–in the moment he died saving her life. Now when he’s not using his new healing powers to help people, he watches helplessly as Avery’s life is unraveled by his death. To help her, he risks everything by breaking the rules, dangerously
    blurring the barriers between life and death.</p><p><strong>Praise for the Book</strong></p><p>“Vividly imagined, this novel is the perfect mix of modern love story and literary fiction. One brimming with genuine emotion that had me re-reading passages simply because they were too beautifully written to experience just once.” –Julie N. Ford, author
    of With No Regrets</p><p>“This book is not only an engaging and satisfying supernatural romance, but also a beautiful story about life, death, and the gray places in between.” –E.B. Wheeler, author of The Haunting of Springett Hall<br>“This is one of those stories that stays
    with you long after the closing scene. It was beautifully imagined and vividly written and I absolutely loved it!” –Teresa Richards, author of Emerald Bound</p><p><strong>Excerpt</strong></p><p>EXCERPT 1 (Kai’s point-of-view):<br>I’m not sure if I have a heart, but something in my ribcage swells at the sight of Avery. Her hair shimmers like spun gold in the sunlight, falling over her shoulder and hiding her face. She’s sitting on a sheet of
    black rock, head bent, and the flowery skirt of her sundress ripples in the breeze.<br>If she turns around, she’ll see me. If I speak, she’ll hear my voice. I open my mouth to do that, but it’s parched, hit with an unexpected drought of words.<br>I’ve
    been walking for hours, and I still don’t have a solid plan. I have an end goal, but it’s like looking up at the peak of a mountain when I’m still in the valley. I want Avery to find happiness again, but I have no idea how to get her there.</p><p><strong>Author Sarah Beard</strong><br>Sarah Beard is the author of YA novels Porcelain Keys and Beyond the Rising Tide. She earned a degree in communications from the University of Utah and is currently pursuing an MFA in writing from VCFA. When she’s
    not writing, she referees wrestling matches between her three boys and listens to audiobooks while folding self-replicating piles of laundry. She is a breast cancer survivor, a baker of sweets, a seeker of good love stories, a composer of melancholy
    music, and a traveler who wishes her travel budget was much bigger. She lives with her husband and children in the shadow of the beautiful Wasatch Mountains.</p><p><a href="http://sarahbeard.com/">Website</a> * <a href="https://twitter.com/AuthorSarahB">Twitter</a> * <a href="https://www.facebook.com/authorsarahbeard">Facebook</a></p><p><strong>Blog Tour Giveaway</strong></p><p>$25 Amazon Gift Card or Paypal Cash</p><p>Ends 8/1/16</p><p>Open only to those who can legally enter, receive and use an <a href="http://Amazon.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon.com</a> Gift Code or Paypal Cash.

    <p>16-year-old Aurora Darlington is an orphan. Mistreated by her adopted family and bullied at school, she dreams of running away and being free. But when she is kidnapped and dragged through a portal into a magical world, suddenly her old life doesn’t
        seem so bad.</p>
    <p>Avalonia is a dangerous land ruled by powerful mages and a cruel, selfish queen who will do anything to control all seven kingdoms—including killing anyone who stands in her way.</p>
    <p>Thrust headlong into this new, magical world, Aurora’s arrival sets plans in motion that threaten to destroy all she holds dear.</p>
    <p>With the help of a young fae, a magical pegasus, and a handsome mage, Aurora journeys across Avalonia to learn the truth about her past and unleash the power within herself. Kingdoms collide as a complicated web of political intrigue and ancient magic
        lead Aurora to unravel a shocking secret that will change her life forever.</p>

For a limited time only!**</strong></p><p><strong>EXCERPT</strong></p><p>For a second that felt like a lifetime, everything stopped; I felt like I was floating in nothingness. Then I blinked, and, when I finally opened my eyes and focused again through the tears, I couldn’t believe what I was seeing.</p><p>I found myself standing at the mouth of a small cave situated on a hill and overlooking a quiet, moonlit valley. On my left, a dark forest stretched out as far as the eye could see, treetops glistening silver in the light of the full moon. The hills around
    us undulated into wildflower-filled meadows that lay sleeping in the dewy night.</p><p>Far down in the valley, I could see a little village, its lights twinkling in the distance. To my right, a waterfall splashed playfully into a small river that ran down into a lake, next to which the little village was built. The moon here was fuller
    and larger than I had ever seen it, and the night sky was awash with a fantastic array of glittering stars.</p><p>Had I passed through the tapestry? Where was I?</p><p>I looked around, disbelief clouding my judgment. I was still trying to get my bearings after that strange moment when I had been inside the tapestry and nowhere at the same time. It gave me a funny feeling, as though I had been lifted out of my own consciousness
    and then put back into my body.</p><p>A warm breeze brushed past my face and played with my hair. Gone were the cloudy grey mist and the cold, nipping wind of the English countryside. I drew in a sharp breath—the air was crisp and clear, sweet smelling, and fresh. The moonlit valley was filled
    with fruit trees, wildflowers, and rolling meadows.</p><p>“How did we come here? Where are we?” I asked, still confused.</p><p>“You really are ignorant,” said Oblek, glancing at me. “I take it your uncle didn’t tell you anything?”</p><p>I shook my head and looked down. Oblek had tied my hands with a rope he had with him while I was still dazed and looking around. It was humiliating, and the rough ropes cut into my wrists, rubbing them raw every time he pulled me forward.</p><p>I had to find some way out of this. And, at the moment, the only thing I could do was discover more about where I was. Then, when I got an opportunity, I could escape and find my way back up to the cave on the hill, where we had arrived out of the tapestry.</p><p>But then what?</p><p>Christopher was probably dead, and Aunt Arianna would doubtless blame me for everything since I had disappeared at the same time. I had no idea what to do. I didn’t really want to go back, and, now that my adoptive parents were dead, I had nothing to
    return to.</p><p>I was starting to panic. I had nowhere to go, and my mind was imagining an array of horrible outcomes of my kidnapping. My palms had become sweaty, and my racing heart was thundering in my chest as I half-walked and half-ran, desperately trying to keep
    up with Oblek’s giant strides.</p><p>“Why are you doing this?” I pleaded with my kidnapper.</p><p>But Lord Oblek said nothing. He didn’t even look at me. He just kept walking ahead and dragging me along behind him, with no more explanations as to what he was planning to do with me.</p><p>I was terrified, and I had no idea if I was going to survive this. But I tried to be brave. Maybe I could talk my way out of this?</p><p>“You do know that this is called kidnapping?” I said, trying to reason with Oblek.</p><p>He didn’t bother to answer.</p><p>“What will happen to me now?” I squeaked, my voice breaking, as I tried not to cry.</p><p>“Queen Morgana will decide what is to be done with you,” said Oblek, finally.</p><p>Queen Morgana! The woman from my dream? It was not possible that this, too, was a coincidence. It must be the same Morgana, the one who had tried to kill my real mother.</p><p>Who the hell was she?</p><p>Suddenly all of this seemed extremely scary. I hoped that I was still dreaming and that there was no way I had actually traveled through a magical tapestry into some strange land. It all seemed very exciting in books. But actually being kidnapped and
    then hauled around like an animal, traveling deep into a land I knew nothing about, was not my idea of fun.</p><p>I had to get away from this horrible man, and fast.</p><picture>
