**Beyond the Rising Tide by Sarah Beard**

Kai met Avery only once--in the moment he died saving her life. Now when he's not using his new healing powers to help people, he watches helplessly as Avery's life is unraveled by his death. To help her, he risks everything by breaking the rules, dangerously blurring the barriers between life and death.

**Praise for the Book**

"Vividly imagined, this novel is the perfect mix of modern love story and literary fiction. One brimming with genuine emotion that had me re-reading passages simply because they were too beautifully written to experience just once." --Julie N. Ford, author of With No Regrets

"This book is not only an engaging and satisfying supernatural romance, but also a beautiful story about life, death, and the gray places in between." --E.B. Wheeler, author of The Haunting of Springett Hall  
"This is one of those stories that stays with you long after the closing scene. It was beautifully imagined and vividly written and I absolutely loved it!" --Teresa Richards, author of Emerald Bound

**Excerpt**

EXCERPT 1 (Kai's point-of-view):  
I'm not sure if I have a heart, but something in my ribcage swells at the sight of Avery. Her hair shimmers like spun gold in the sunlight, falling over her shoulder and hiding her face. She's sitting on a sheet of black rock, head bent, and the flowery skirt of her sundress ripples in the breeze.  
If she turns around, she'll see me. If I speak, she'll hear my voice. I open my mouth to do that, but it's parched, hit with an unexpected drought of words.  
I've been walking for hours, and I still don't have a solid plan. I have an end goal, but it's like looking up at the peak of a mountain when I'm still in the valley. I want Avery to find happiness again, but I have no idea how to get her there.
